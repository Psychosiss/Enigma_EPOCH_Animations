# Enigma_EPOCH_Animations
Enable Animations to be seen serverwide when executed on an Epoch Client


The purpose of this addon is to allow anyone executing animations on a client to easily transfer that animation across to all players within a specified range.

Normally this is done through the use of bis_fnc_mp however that has currently been disabled by the Epoch Devs.

I have currently copied the same file structure as the Epoch_Server.pbo - 
The idea behind this is that anyone used to looking inside that file structure will easily be able to copy any future code changes etc across to this pbo that either the devs or anyone else may add at a future date whilst maintaining an unmodified epoch_server.pbo
